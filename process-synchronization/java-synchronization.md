# Java Synchronization

When one application access with multiple thread **concurrently**, and data consistency is preserved, we call this **Thread Safe**

## **Bounded Buffer**

### **Busy Waiting**

We described busy waiting in semaphore section:

> Major drawback of above approach is that every process needs busy waiting  
> ****That is, if one process is in their critical section, all other process have to run its entry section over and over again.  
> Busy waiting wastes CPU time of waiting processes.

To solve this, process waiting queue is one option. In Java, **Thread.yield\(\)** will do this.

But, consider this scenario:  
\(Note that JVM prefers high priority process than low priority process in scheduling\)

1. Producer has high priority than Consumer
2. Buffer is full
3. Producer yield\(\) \(or busy wait\) until count &lt; BUFFER\_SIZE

As consumer has low priority than producer, Consumer will never be scheduled with JVM.  
This situation called **Livelock**

### Race Condition

We described race condition in background section:

> Condition that multiple process manipulating to same data and result of the operation depends on the sequence of executing each commands is called "**Race Condition**"

In Java, we use **synchronized** keyword for this.

Before we go, note that

* Every object in java is related to one lock
* Object's Lock owned by one Thread

When one method defined with synchronized and called, it requires lock of this object.

If Thread A calls synchronized method and another thread B owns object O's lock,  
thread A is blocked and put in entry set for object O.

When thread ends method, object O's lock is released.

When lock is released, JVM chooses random\(?\) thread of object O's entry set.

```java
// Entry set insert / lock implementation

public synchronized void insert(Object item) {
    while (count == BUFFER_SIZE) {
        Thread.yield();
    }
    ++count;
    buffer[in] = item;
    in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}

public synchronized Object remove() {
    Object = item;
    
    while (count == 0) {
        Thread.yield();
    }
    
    --count;
    item = buffer[out];
    out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
    
    return item;
}
```

### Deadlock
