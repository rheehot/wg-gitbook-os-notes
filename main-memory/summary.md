# Summary

## Hardware Support

**Single or Multiple Separation**  
Does not need hardware Support

**Paging / Segmentation**  
Needs hardware support \(Mapping Table\)

## Performance

The more structure becomes complicated, the more time takes to convert logical address to physical address.  
If paging and segmentation have to manipulated in main memory, memory access speed would be very slow.

**TLB** device can resolve this.

## Fragmentation

**Fixed Size Allocation System** like paging or single partition would have **internal fragmentation problem**

**Variable Size Allocation System** like Segmentation or multiple partition would have **external fragmentation problem**

## **Relocation**

// TODO
