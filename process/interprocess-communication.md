# Interprocess Communication

Processes which affects / be affected by other processes are called cooperating process. These processes take advantage of:

1. **Information Sharing** : Multiple user can access to same datas like sharing files.
2. **Computation speedup** : We can divide a task into subtasks and process those tasks in parallel.
3. **Modularity** : We may want to divide task into multiple process or threads for modularity.
4. **Convenience** : One user may perform multiple tasks like editing, printing, compiling at same time.

![a. message passing, b. shared memory](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

Cooperating process needs **Interprocess Communication : IPC**  
There are two models for this: 1. **Shared Memory** 2. **Message Passing**
